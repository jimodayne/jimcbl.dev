This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is my personal website, built with Next.js for the framework and Tailwind CSS for quick styling.

## Features

- Dark mode: toggle between light and dark mode by clicking the moon icon in the top right corner.
- Responsive design: the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
- Custom hooks: use custom hooks to get scroll position, scroll direction for animations.
- Easy customization: Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach makes it simple to change styles without writing custom CSS.
- Google Fonts: use Google Fonts to load Lato, a custom font for the website.
- Deployed on Vercel: the website is deployed on Vercel and is live at a custom domain [jimcbl.dev](https://jimcbl.dev).
